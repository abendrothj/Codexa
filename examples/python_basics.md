# Getting Started with Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

## Installing Python

Download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

## Hello World

The simplest Python program:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Variables and Data Types

Python supports various data types:

- **Strings**: Text data
- **Integers**: Whole numbers
- **Floats**: Decimal numbers
- **Lists**: Ordered collections
- **Dictionaries**: Key-value pairs

Example:

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30
height = 5.6
skills = ["Python", "JavaScript", "SQL"]
profile = {"name": name, "age": age}
```

## Functions

Define reusable code blocks with functions:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

message = greet("Alice")
print(message)
```

## Next Steps

- Learn about control flow (if/else, loops)
- Explore object-oriented programming
- Study Python's standard library
- Build real-world projects
